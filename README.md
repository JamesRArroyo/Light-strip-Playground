# ESP Light Strip Controller

Control multiple light strips each on their own ESP8266. Supports OTA updates.

## Prerequisites

- Install Node.jsÂ® and npm if they are not already on your machine.
- Update `src/ArduinoCode/ArduinoCode.ini` variables (Wifi, Node ip, etc..)

## Start server
- Initially install dependencies by running ```npm install```
- Run `npm start` to spin up the node server.

## Exporting Arduino Code
  
  1. Copy the ArduinoCode folder (found in src/) into the dist folder after your have run `npm start`
  2. Open up dist/ArduinoCode/ArduinoCode.ini in Arduino Sketch
  3. Verify/Compile the code. ```(Sketch->Verify/Compile)```
  4. Export compiled binary. ```(Sketch->Export Compiled Binary)```
  5. The new compiled code is now ready to be pulled for updates.

## Current way of updating (Still in the works)

* OTA Update Setup
  - **IMPORTANT STEP** - Kill Node Server
  - Plug in ESP8266
  - Open up src/ArduinoCode/ArduinoCode.ini in Arduino Sketch
  - Upload Code to the ESP8266 via USB and Arduino Sketch.
  - **IMPORTANT STEP** - Once upload is finished press the reset button on the ESP8266.
  - Your device may be unplugged and is ready for OTA updates.

* OTA Updates (This process will get better)
  - Increment the `FW_VERSION` number when changes have been made to `dist/ArduinoCode/ArduinoCode.ini` and they are ready to be deployed to your devices.
  - Export compiled binary. ```(Sketch->Export Compiled Binary)```
  - Update the `firmwareVersionNumber` in `src/firmwareUpdate/firmwareUpdate.routes.ts` to match the new version number in the previous step. 
  - Hit the reset button the the ESP8266 or unplug/plug in the power. (Updates are checked when the device initially boots).
